\section{Errata and Known Issues}

\subsection{Errata}
\begin{itemize}
      \item{
            Care should be taken in creating instances of \textbf{DynamicFifo}
            with internal very large memory (hundreds or thousands of memory
            cells) as this can generate very large designs. There is currently
            no checks or constraints on users from doing this.
            }

      \item{
            Care should be taken regarding dynamically changing the values on
            the \textit{almostEmptyLevel} and \textit{almostFullLevel} ports
            when the FIFO is not empty as that may result in unpredictable
            behaviors on the \textit{almostEmpty} and \textit{almostFull} flags.
            }
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Known Issues}
None.
