\section{Errata and Known Issues}

\subsection{Errata}
\begin{itemize}
      \item{
            Care should be taken when configuring the Timer with large count widths, as this can lead to significant resource usage in synthesis.
            }
      \item{
            The Timer module does not currently support dynamic reconfiguration of parameters during operation. Any changes to parameters require a reset.
            }
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Known Issues}
None.
