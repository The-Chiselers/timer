\section{Simulation}

\subsection{Tests}
The test bench for the Timer module includes directed tests that verify the functionality of the counter, PWM generation, and interrupt signaling. The tests cover the following scenarios:

\begin{itemize}
  \item{Basic counter operation.}
  \item{PWM generation with varying duty cycles.}
  \item{Timer time to max with varying prescaler.}
  \item{Verifying duty cycle over multiple periods.}
  \item{Randomized max count and prescaler.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Code Coverage}
All inputs and outputs are checked to ensure they toggle at least once during simulation. An error will be thrown if any port fails to toggle.

\subsection{Running Simulation}
Simulations can be run directly from the command prompt as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
  $ sbt test
\end{verbatim}

or from make as follows:

\texttt{\$ make test}
